Welcome to Like-A-Fox, MySQL Viewer

This project came about from me being bored one evening. I wanted to play around with Python and MySQL and this is what came out.


Notes:
*Make sure your MySQL account has the correct permissions to access the databases remotely.

*Use of this software is at your own risk. I have tested it on my own MySQL databases and everything works fine but I am not responsible if you royally bung up your servers. Always try out a new version on a test database before using it on your main databases.




Changelog:

***Updated June 4 2012***

When performing a select query you can now have multiple where statements using "or".

For example: select column from table where column = A or column = B or .... or column = Z;

Note: The value of "column" and the type of operator (Equals, Is Greater Than, ect.) in the where statements are the same.

To accomplish this fill out the information as if you are performing a select statement with only one "where" clause except in the vary last text box (where you would enter the value for your where statement) enter a list of values separated by a comma (eg. 567,8910,111213).

***Updated April 16 2012***

There is now a check box when inserting a CSV that allows you to specify whether the first row of the CSV contains the columns for your insert statement. For example, if your MySQL statement would be

"INSERT INTO table (column3,column6,column8) VALUES(XX,YY,ZZ)"

Then the first row of the CSV would have to be:

column3,column6,column8

Previous to this update you would have had to add NULL values in each row of your CSV to correspond to missing columns. As Like-A-Fox needed the rows to match the table exactly.


***April 12 2012***

You can now choose to have the results of your "Select" query exported to a comma separated file instead of being printed to the screen (This is a very quick way to export all the records from a table).

As well I have added the ability to import a comma separated file into a MySQL table. 

When you select a database you are now given three selections, perform a "Select" query on the database and print the results to the screen, perform a "Select" query on the database and export the results to a CSV file, or insert data into the database.

To perform an insert each line of the CSV must confirm to the column specifications of the table you are inserting into. For example, if your MySQL statement would be "INSERT INTO table VALUES(XX,YY,ZZ)" then your CSV needs to be formatted as:

XX,YY,ZZ
XX2,YY2,ZZ2
XX3,YY3,ZZ3
etc.

Where each line is a separate insert statement for the table.

***February 24, 2012***

Currently you can only perform a select query with only 1 "where" condition. More features to be added as more boring evenings occur :)
